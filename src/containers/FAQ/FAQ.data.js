      'Please do not send a sick child to school. If a child arrives with symptoms of illness, the child will not be permitted to stay. Children will be excluded from contact with the other children; seated with the staff at the front desk until parents can be notified. Please notify us if your child becomes ill and will not be attending that day. We ask that parents notify us when their child contracts a communicable disease. The preschool will notify all other parents about any communicable disease outbreaks (This does not name the child involved just the classroom to indicate highest exposure). A child will not be permitted to attend preschool when he or she have vomited or had diarrhea during the previous 24 hours. Medication may not be administered during program hours, therefore, do not send any in with your child.',

      "Yes we do. We have a music teacher and a Spanish teacher on our faculty. Both conduct morning classes Monday through Friday to provide continuity in the learning experience. Music and language experiences in the early years are very important.</p><p>We start toddlers in our music class to encourage the appreciation of singing and playing and listening to instruments. Music enhances brain development, especially spatial orientation and the ability to think mathematically. Our music teacher also includes many movement and literacy activities in the class. The brain is most receptive to learning languages during early childhood. That's why we start two-year-old children in Spanish class.",
